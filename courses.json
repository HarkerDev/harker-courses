While reading groundbreaking poets such as e.e. cummings, Gertrude Stein, Sylvia Plath, Elizabeth Bishop and Allen Ginsberg, students will also learn of the social, political and literary forces that led to specific poetic movements. As students examine poems, poetic statements, biographical excerpts, era film clips and interviews, they will consider relationships between the various poetic eras and become more comfortable reading and analyzing the work of later poets who tend to discard linear narrative in favor of image, sound, formal experimentation and abstraction. Students will even get a chance to write a few of their own original poems. Ultimately, by reviewing basic poetic literary techniques, this course aims to foster a love and excitement of poetry�s complexity and allow students to feel inspired by a poem that might have seemed otherwise incomprehensible.

The satellite link between Mars and Earth is flakey, so it may take repeated transmissions to get the information across. At the same time, transmission takes a toll on the limited battery power of the vehicle, so it may help to eliminate repetitive aspects of the monotonous Martian landscape without losing much information. What is the best way for the Mars exploration vehicle to communicate the photos and videos back to earth?\nIn addressing such problems, Information Theorists have created a rich mathematical framework that addresses fundamental question such as: What exactly is information and how is it measured? How can we communicate it reliably and efficiently across distances? Are there any fundamental limits to communication? Our course will explore all these questions.\nTopics covered include:  \n-Source characterization, Compression problem (lossless version), Common codes, Entropy, Source coding theorem (lossless version)\n-Channel characterization, Coding problem (cost-oblivious version), Hamming and Reed-Solomon codes, Relative Entropy, a.k.a.
